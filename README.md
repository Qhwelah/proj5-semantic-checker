==================================================

## Running
1. To run the env tests, first replace any files you need with original copies, although none
    of the nontarget files in this project are modified.

2. Modify the RunTest.bat file to point to your correct java jdk directory.
    I have several different versions installed, so i need a specific file path.

3. Also in the RunTest.bat file, feel free to move around/add/replace any file paths needed to 
    some new or old test programs by shifting around the comment command.

4. In the terminal, cd into src

5. run ```cmd.exe /c ".\RunTest.bat"``` on Windows or equivalent on your OS to run the bat file.

6. TestEnv reslts will be printed in console, and code sample outputs will be sent into their 
    corresponding text files.
