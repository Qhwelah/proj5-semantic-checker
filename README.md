Parse Tree Generator and Chained Symbol Table

==================================================

Currently, only the Env section is completed. 

I hope to resubmit with a complete application of the Parse Tree within a day. 

If I manage that, then you will not be reading this readme.

## Running
1. To run the env tests, first replace any files you need with original copies, although none
    of the nontarget files in this project are modified.

2. Modify the RunTest.bat file to point to your correct java jdk directory.
    I have several different versions installed, so i need a specific file path.

3. In the terminal, cd into src

4. run ```cmd.exe /c ".\run.bat"``` on Windows or equivalent on your OS to run the bat file.
    Currently, only base operations like running the flex and yacc operations are active 
    as well as the TestEnv file. 
    
All samples in "samples/." are currently ignored as I am not there yet.
