==================================================

## Running
1. To run the env tests, first replace any files you need with original copies, although none
    of the nontarget files in this project are modified.

2. Modify the RunTest.bat file to point to your correct java jdk directory.
    I have several different versions installed, so i need a specific file path.

3. Also in the RunTest.bat file, feel free to move around/add/replace any file paths needed to 
    some new or old test programs by shifting around the comment commands.

4. In the terminal, cd into src

5. run ```cmd.exe /c ".\RunTest.bat"``` on Windows or equivalent on your OS to run the bat file.

6. Currently, the programs from hw5, i.e. the TestEnv and success files, are commented out in
    the bat file. If you need to run them for any reason, just change the goto command above them.
